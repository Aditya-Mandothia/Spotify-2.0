# Loopify 
# Loopify is a music player application that uses spotfiy's public API's to fetch the requiste data and enable users across the platform to listen to their taste of music. The USP of the project/app is that it has no advertisments or sponsorships, which cuts off the most irritating and time consuming part while running web apps.
